# Psychiatrist Chatbot
## Overview
- The code employs the **Discord.js** library in order to connect to a bot channel created by the members for this purpose. </br>
- As soon as the ***my_bot.js*** file is run, the bot channel on Discord can be opened and used to interact with the bot. </br>
- The code uses trigger keywords with associated replies from the fictional Dr.Hannibal Lecter. </br>
- The user-defined functions do the job of converting user's messages into forms that trigger a reply from the bot. </br>
- The functions are stored in the ***functions*** folder.

## Working
- Start the conversation by a greeting to the text channel on Discord. </br>
- A reply is usually accompanied by a gif from the bot, which is related to the bot's (Dr. Hannibal Lecter/Silence of the Lambs) theme.</br>
- If a user is going through a condition, the bot replies with an option to provide with online resources that could be referred to. </br>
- The bot also gives some words of advice to the user. </br>
- The bot also prompts the user to book an appointment if needed, and sets one if there is a time slot available. </br>
